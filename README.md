This repository contains everything I use to set up, run, and maintain my computers.

I have historically relied on ad hoc configuration,
but I've become interested in tools the provide declarative, deterministic, version-controlled configuration,
and in particular [Nix](https://nixos.org/).

I use decision records to capture the context and outcomes of critcal decisions,
and notes to capture more mundane day-to-day work.
Writing helps me organize my thoughts, provides a reference for future me,
and hopefully helps anyone trying to understand what's in this repo.
