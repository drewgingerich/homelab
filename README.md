This repository contains everything I use to set up, run, and maintain my home server. While I currently rely on ad hoc shell commands for many things, my goal is to capture everything as version-controlled configuration executable by tools like Ansible and Docker.

I use my home server primarily to store and serve media, such as movies, photos, and books. I also use it to occasionally host servers for games including Minecraft and Valheim. There are a few other miscellaneous services running as well.

I am using Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document important decisions about the hardware and software I'm using for my home server. Check out the [ADR index](./docs/architecture/decisions) to see these records.
