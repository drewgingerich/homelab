# Testing a new HDD

I want to make sure that the new HDD I have is working well before I start putting data on it.

After some looking around, it seems that a combination of
[SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Monitoring,_Analysis_and_Reporting_Technology) and
[Badblocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badblocks) is the most common method.

The procedure I'll go with is:

1. Run Badblocks
2. Run SMART long test

[TrueNAS Forum: Hard Drive Burn-in Testing](https://www.truenas.com/community/resources/hard-drive-burn-in-testing.92/)
[S.M.A.R.T. â€“ Short, Extended and Conveyance Self-Tests](https://ipfail.org/useful/s-m-a-r-t-short-extended-and-conveyance-self-tests/)

I see that `badblocks` and `smartctl` are already installed:

```sh
$ type badblocks
badblocks is /usr/sbin/badblocks
$ type smartctl
smartctl is /usr/sbin/smartctl
```

I believe `badblocks` is installed on my machine by default,
and I previously installed [smartmontools](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Smartmontools) for `smartctl`.

To figure out the drive path, I get some information using `lsblk`:

```sh
$ lsblk -o PATH,SIZE,SERIAL,WWN
PATH         SIZE SERIAL          WWN
/dev/loop0  50.8M

/dev/sdf9      8M                 0x50014ee266677aa0
```

The drive at `/dev/sdb` is the one I want,
because it's the only 8TB drive.
I could look at the serial number on the drive to be sure,
but I'm feeling lazy and don't want to pull it out.
I do compare to the output of `zpool status` to double check that it's not part of my ZFS pool.

Badblocks only runs as a foreground application and runs for a long time,
so I'll need to use a multiplexer like tmux to keep my shell session alive.

Calling tmux by itself starts a session:

```sh
$ tmux
```

For large devices (>2TB) it appears that the block size should be manually specified as 4096 when running Badblocks.

```sh
$ tmux
$ sudo badblocks -ws -b 4096 /dev/sdb
```

I disconnect from the tmux session with the default tmux hotkey sequence of `ctrl+b d`.
I reattach to the latest session by running `tmux a` to check on progress.

It takes about 4 days to finish, and no errors are detected!

```sh
$ tmux a
$ sudo badblocks -ws -b 4096 /dev/sdb
Testing with pattern 0xaa: done
Reading and comparing: done
Testing with pattern 0x55: done
Reading and comparing: done
Testing with pattern 0xff: done
Reading and comparing: done
Testing with pattern 0x00: done
Reading and comparing: done
```

I kill the tmux session with ` tmux kill-session -t 0`.

Next I run a SMART long test:

```sh
sudo smartctl -t long /dev/sdb
```
```
...
Please wait 830 minutes for test to complete.
```

Now I wait again.

After it finishes, I check the results with:

```sh
sudo smartctl -a /dev/sdb
```
```

These results look good: The status of the extended offline test is `Completed without error`.

Since both Badblocks and the SMART long test passed,
this drive appears healthy and ready to be used!
