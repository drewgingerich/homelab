# 6. Take steps to protect data

Date: 2023-07-09

## Status

Accepted

## Context

There are many ways to lose data, from hardware failure to natural disaster.
Computers can fail, and failure can cause data loss.
Some data is replacable and losing it is only inconvenient,
for example service configuration and state.
Other data is not replacable and losing it is permanant,
for example photos.

I do not want to lose data.
I especially do not want to lose irreplacable data.

## Decision

I will back up the data on my server regularly.

## Consequences

I will be protected from data loss to a degree I find acceptable.

I will need to design a backup system and balance its complexity, storage cost, and data safety.

I will need to regularly check that my backup system is working.

I will need to pay for the storage used by backups,
be it external storage, cloud storage, or something else.
