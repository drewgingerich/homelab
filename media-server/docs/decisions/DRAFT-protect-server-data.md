# 11. Mitigate the risk of data loss

Date: 2023-08-02

## Status

Accepted

## Context

My server stores data that is valuable to me. I do not want to lose this data.

An event with the potential to cause data loss is likely to happen at some point.
Every hard disk will die eventually, for example.

The potential causes of data loss that I've identified are as follows.

- Data degredation in memory
- Data degredation in storage
- User error
- Software error
- Hardware failure
- Natural disaster
- Malware

No data protection system is 100% effective.

## Decision

I will take steps to mitigate the risk of data loss.

## Consequences

The risk of data loss will be reduced to an amount I find acceptable.

I will need to design and maintain a system to mitigate the risk of data loss.
