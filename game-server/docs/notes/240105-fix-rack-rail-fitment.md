After installing the rails and inserting the case, I noticed that one of the rails was not able to fully extend because it was getting stuck behind the rack.
I did some research and saw that [poor fitment is a known issue with StarTech open racks](https://web.archive.org/web/20240106075009/https://old.reddit.com/r/sliger/comments/11bvvww/these_cases_will_not_fit_a_standard_19_rack/).

Rolling the rack onto a more flat section of floor fixes the issue.
The tolerances on my particular rack and rails are extremely tight and the rack is not completely rigid,
so an uneven floor warps the frame enough to block the rail despite my best efforts to level it.
On a flat floor I still need to jiggle the rack sometimes to get the rail to fully slide out.

If this becomes more of an issue in the future, one commenter on the above thread fixed it by loosening the rack bolts and then re-tightening them.
For now, I wanted to move the rack anyways.
