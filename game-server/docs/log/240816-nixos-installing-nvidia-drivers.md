    # Nvidia power management. Experimental, and can cause sleep/suspend to fail.

Got error when GPU not passed in as a PCIe device:

```sh
$ nvidia-smi
NVIDIA-SMI has failed because it couldn't communicate with the NVIDIA driver. Make sure that the latest NVIDIA driver is installed and running.
```

Figured this was because the drivers were not loading since no Nvidia GPU was detected.
After passing the GPU as a PCIe device it worked:

```sh
$ nvidia-smi
