I bought a [StarTech.com USB Bluetooth 5.0 receiver](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B2737HPS?ref=ppx_pop_dt_b_product_details&th=1) to connect my controller using the ezcoo hub.
At first this worked great, but pretty soon I experienced connection issues:

- Trouble pairing
- Random disconnections
- Frozen connections, where the controller would be connected but nonfunctional

I though it might be the USB receiver, or it might be some Bluetooth settings on my computer.
I didn't feel like looking at computer stuff, so I bought a [TP-Link USB Bluetooth 5 receiver](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DMP6T22?ref=ppx_pop_dt_b_product_details&th=1).
So far it's working great.
