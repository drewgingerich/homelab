I thought the issue might be due to using Wayland somehow,
so I tried forcing use of X11 instead.

```nix
services.xserver.displayManager.gdm.wayland = false;
```

After a reboot, `nvidia-smi` showed no running processes.

```sh
$ nvidia-smi

Not great. Looking at `journalctl` didn't show much.

```sh
$ sudo journalctl -r | less
Aug 17 09:55:37 nixos sunshine[1647]: [2024:08:17:09:55:37]: Info: Terminate handler called
```

Looking at systemd unit status only shows that it's dead.

```sh
$ sudo systemctl --user --machine=steam@ status sunshine
â—‹ sunshine.service - Self-hosted game stream host for Moonlight
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/user/sunshine.service; enabled; preset: enabled)
     Active: inactive (dead)
```

I decided to go back to Wayland and troubleshoot there.

After switching back, things appeared to be working.
It seems like an intermittent problem that I'll have to keep an eye on.

Looking at the display settings in the GUI,
I did notice that there was a second monitor there titled _Red Hat, Inc. 15"_.

After thinking about where this might be coming from,
I realized that I hadn't removed the _Default_ display hardware in the Proxmox VM settings.
This second display was a virtual one.
Since it could be conflicting with the HDMI dummy plug, I removed it in the Proxmox GUI.

This resulted in getting a text mode login at boot again.

I tried out `sddm` instead of `gdm` as a long shot,
in case the display manager had any influence.

```nix
services.xserver.displayManager.sddm.enable = true;
```

It still didn't provide a GUI login screen, though the text-mode login looked a bit different.
I switched back to `gdm`.

At this point I didn't have a great idea of where to go.
It seemed like the dummy HDMI plug wasn't being detected, configured, or used properly.
I'm not familiar with how displays and display managers work in Linux.

The next steps I could think of were:

1. Look at `gdm` logs. There might be an obvious error.
2. Try to see if the HDMI display is being detected and configured properly.
