# 2. Use Ubuntu VM for gaming

Date: 2023-12-27

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I'm not familiar with Windows and I don't want to spend the time to learn right now.

I've heard anecdotally that [Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton), and more generally [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/), enables many Windows games to run well on Linux these days.
I am comfortable with Linux, and I appreciate the control that using Linux provides.

I am most familiar with the Ubuntu distrobution of Linux.
Ubuntu has a large and active community, which makes learning and troubleshooting easier.

## Decision

I will play games on an Ubuntu VM.

## Consequences

I will manage a Linux system, rather than a Windows one.

I will use Ubuntu, which I am familiar with and which has a large and active community.

I will need to learn how to use Proton, Wine, or another tool to play Windows games on Linux.
