# Use Moonlight and Sunshine to stream games

## Problem

I want to be able to stream games from my game server to other devices,
such as my laptop.

## Options

- [Steam Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_Link)
- [Moonlight](https://moonlight-stream.org/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/moonlight-stream)) and [Sunshine](https://app.lizardbyte.dev/Sunshine/?lng=en) ([GitHub](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine))
- [Parsec](https://parsec.app/)
- [NoMachine](https://www.nomachine.com/)

## Solution

Use Moonlight+Sunshine to stream games.

## Side effects

No money!

As free open-source software, Moonlight+Sunshine presents a less polished experience than paid services.
and I will have to put in more work to set up and maintain these softwares.

Being open-source, I have to opportunity to contribute back to these softwares.

## Context

### Steam Link

I had a decent experience with Steam Link.
It is the most convenient option since it's built into Steam and I'm using Steam anyways.
The stream quality was good: it looked decent and felt responsive and stable.

The major downside I experienced was troubleshooting difficulty.
Becuase the stream connection is closely tied to the health of the game process,
when a game would crash or freeze I wasn't able to use Steam Link to troubleshoot or kill the game process.
In some cases I had to reboot my computer or connect a physical display to resolve the issue.
If I were to use Steam Link, I would want a separate remote desktop software as well.

### Moonlight+Sunshine

I have used Moonlight+Sunshine to stream several hundred hours of gameplay at this point,
and I've had a good experience.

Setup was fairly smooth, but did require some troubleshooting.
Documentation was all right.

Since Moonlight+Sunshine streams the whole desktop,
I can use it as general remote desktop software in addition to streaming games.

### Parsec

I didn't try Parsec.
I've seen around the internet that people like it,
but I like to avoid subscriptions and private software when possible.

### NoMachine

I didn't try NoMachine.
I've seen around the internet that people like it,
but it sounds like it's more optimized as a remote desktop software than game streaming software.

There are other remote desktop softwares that fall into this catagory.
