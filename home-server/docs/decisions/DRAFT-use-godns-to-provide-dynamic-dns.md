# 18. Use GoDNS to provide dynamic DNS

Date: 2023-09-04

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The issue motivating this decision, and any context that influences or constrains the decision.

## Decision

Use `GoDNS` to provide dynamic DNS.

## Consequences

I get the same dynamic DNS functionality as `ddclient`.

I get to use a tool that uses a YAML configuration file that I understand better.

I get to use an open-source tool that I have the interest and potential of contributing to.
