# Use selected hardware

## Goal

Have a reliable server for storing data---
such as photos, videos, and documents---
and running self-hosted services.

## Decision

Continue to use the following parts.

| Part Name                                      | Type         |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| EVGA GAMING GeForce GTX 1060 6GB               | GPU          |
| Intel Core i3-6100 3.7 GHz                     | CPU          |
| Supermicro MBD-X11SSM-F-O Micro ATX LGA1151    | Motherboard  |
| 4 x Crucial CT16G4WFD8266 16 GB DDR4-2666 CL19 | Memory       |
| SeaSonic FOCUS Plus 650 Gold                   | Power Supply |
| Crucial MX500 250 GB 2.5" SSD                  | Storage      |
| 4 x Western Digital Red 4 TB 3.5" 5400 RPM HDD | Storage      |
| Fractal Design Node 804                        | Case         |

## Side effects

The CPU is not very strong, so it doesn't always perform well when running game servers
such as for Minecraft and Valheim.

## Context

These are the parts my media server currently uses,
and it's running well.

Of particular note is the ECC RAM,
which I selected the CPU and motherboard to support.
