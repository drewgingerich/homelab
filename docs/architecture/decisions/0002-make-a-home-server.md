# 2. Make a home server

Date: 2023-02-04

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I want somewhere to store media that I own, and to be able to view it remotely.
I would also like a place to install self-hosted software.

My laptop is not a good fit for media because it has a small storage capacity.
It is also not a good fit for self-hosting because it is often asleep and changes locations frequently.

A virtual private server in the cloud is prohibitivly expensive over time, especially for storage space.

## Decision

I will build a home server.

## Consequences

I will have a place to store and acess my media, and to install self-hosted software.

I will spend money up-front to build the server, and subsequently avoid monthly VPS hosting expenses.

I will need to manage the server's hardware and software, including things like security, monitoring, and backups.

I will learn how to build and manage a server.
