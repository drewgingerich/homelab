# 5. Build a game server

## Context

I want to play games that have only been released on Windows.
I want to play modded versions of games.

I have a PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and macOS laptop.
The PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch are not able to run Windows-only games.

I have installed Windows as a secondary OS on my laptop using Boot Camp.
This lets me play Windows-only games.
Restarting my laptop to boot into Windows is inconvenient enough that I rarely do it.
My laptop is not powerful enough to play many modern AAA games.

I don't want to get a Windows laptop.
I like using Linux

My laptop works well for productivity tasks, so I'm not looking to buy another.
I wouldn't want a gaming laptop because I don't like the bulk and price premium.
I wouldn't want a Windows laptop because I'm comfortable with macOS and Linux
for everything except gaming.

I could use a cloud gaming service to play Windows games.
[Nvidia GeForce Now](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/) and [XBox Cloud Gaming](https://www.xbox.com/en-us/play) are the main options.

Cloud gaming is competitive with or cheaper than building a gaming PC.
Building a gaming PC is the same price as 5-10 years of a cloud gaming subscription:
cloud gaming subscriptions cost $10-20 a month,
and the cost of a decent gaming PC is around $1200.
Gaming PCs need to be upgraded every 5-10 years,
so maintaining a PC may continue to cost more.

Cloud gaming eliminates the work of maintaining another computer.
I avoid spending more of my time on computer maintainence.
I miss potential learning opportunities related to system administration.
I have no control over the hardware and software:
I can't use cloud gaming to run other applications,
and modding capabilities are poor.

Cloud gaming provides a limited selection of games.
It is especially restrictive for Indie games.

Cloud gaming is infamous for high latency, stuttering, and poor graphics.
I tested Nvidia GeForce Now by playing Sable: it had good visuals, minor stuttering, and no noticable lag.
I tested XBox Cloud Gaming by playing Starfield: it had noticable lag---eating some of my button inputs, a few moments of high stuttering, and acceptable graphics.
These games are very different and don't make for a rigorous comparison.

Getting a gaming PC and running Windows would let me play Windows-only games.

Getting a Linux PC and using [Proton](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_(software)>) or [Wine](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_(software)>) would let me play Windows-only games.
The ease of use and performance might vary.
Some Windows-only games may not run this way.
I prefer working with Linux over Windows.

I enjoy building computers.

## Decision

I will build a computer for playing games, particularly Windows-only games.

## Consequences

I will research and purchase parts, and build the computer.

I will spend time and effort maintaining the computer.
I will get learning opportunities.

I will decide on using Windows or Linux.
