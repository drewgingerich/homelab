## Context

One option is to get a virtual private server (VPS) in the cloud.
A VPS becomes expensive over time, especially for large amounts storage space and powerful CPUs.

NAS devices are available that come with hardware and software already set up.
These machines provide low complexity storage, and have some ability to run self-hosted software.
They often have low-powered CPUs that are not suitable for higher-performance tasks like running game servers.
The convenience is included in the price, and they are often more expensive than the hardware alone.

There are also black-box servers that come with a full set of hardware, but no software.
These machines offer a wide array of performance levels, including servers way more powerful than I need.
The price per performance is better than NAS solutions.
Often these servers can be bought used, which can be an incredibly cost effective solution.

I could also build a custom machine from scratch.
This presents the best customizability, resonable cost, and a learning opportunity.

## Decision

I will build a server from scratch, and run it at home.

## Consequences

I will have a place to store and acess my media, and to install self-hosted software.

I will spend money up-front to build the server, and subsequently avoid monthly VPS hosting expenses.

I will need to manage the server's hardware and software, including things like security, monitoring, and backups.

I will learn how to build a computer, and I will learn how to configure and manage a server and services.
