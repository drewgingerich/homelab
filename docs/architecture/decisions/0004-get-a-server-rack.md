# 4. Get a server rack

## Context

I'm tentatively planning to get more computers in the future.

My server, modem, and router are currently perched on a small end table and occupy the whole surface.
There is no room for expansion.

Server racks present a standardized way of efficiently packing computer equipment.

There is are options for server rack design and features.

A major choice is whether to get an enclosed or open-frame rack.

Enclosed racks can provide noise dampening, active air flow and dust filtration, security via locking doors, and a cleaner appearance by hiding cables.
Drawbacks include being more expensive, making equipment difficult to access, and being heavy.

Open frame racks can provide easy access to equipment and are cheaper,
but don't do anything about noise, air flow, or security.

My server is stored in the laundry room, so noise and aesthetics are not a large concern.
Dust is present, but my home media server case already provides dust filtration.
There is a lot of free vertical space in the laundry room.

I am new to using server racks, and I am unsure of the size and quantity of equipment I might store in a rack.

## Decision

Get a Startech 25U 4-post open frame server rack (product ID: 4POSTRACK25U).

## Consequences

I will have a server rack to organize my computer equipment.

The price is the same as the 19U rack in the same product line, so I will be able to use more vertical space without additional cost.

Having extra vertical space will give me more flexibility around the equipment I can store.

This rack has an adjustable depth, so I'll be able to change it to adapt to my needs as I figure them out.

I can make shelving out of 2x4s and plywood to make use of space not occupied by rack-mounted gear.

I will likely spend more money on rack-mounted equipment when compared to functionaly equivalent non-rack-mounted equipment,
as there tends to be a premium for the rack compatability.
