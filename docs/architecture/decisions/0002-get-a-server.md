# 2. Get a server

Date: 2019

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I want somewhere to store media that I own, and to be able to view it remotely.
I would also like a place to install self-hosted software.

My laptop is not a good fit for media storage because it has a small storage capacity.
It is also not a good fit for self-hosting because it is often asleep and changes locations frequently.

## Decision

I will get a server.

## Consequences

I will have a place to store and access my media, and to install self-hosted services.

I will need to pay for and manage my server,
and the data and services running on it.
