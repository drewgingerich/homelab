# 2. Build a media server

Date: 2019

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I want somewhere to store media that I own, and to be able to view it remotely.
I would also like a place to install self-hosted software.

My laptop is not a good fit for media storage because it has a small storage capacity.
It also is not good for self-hosting because it is often asleep and changes locations frequently.

One option is to get a virtual private server (VPS) in the cloud.
A VPS becomes expensive over time, especially for large amounts storage space and powerful CPUs.

Pre-built network-attached storage (NAS) devices are available that come with hardware and software already set up.
These machines provide low complexity storage, and have some ability to run self-hosted software.
They often have low-powered CPUs that are not suitable for higher-performance tasks like running game servers.
The convenience is included in the price, and they are often more expensive than the hardware alone.

There are also black-box servers that come with a full set of hardware, but no software.
These machines offer a wide array of performance levels, including servers more powerful than I need.
The price per performance is better than NAS solutions.
Often these servers can be bought used, which can be an incredibly cost effective solution.

I could also build a custom machine from scratch.
This presents the best customizability, resonable cost, and a learning opportunity.

## Decision

I will build a home server for storing media and running self-hosted services.

## Consequences

I will have a place to store and access my media, and to install self-hosted services.

I will spend money up-front to build the server, and subsequently avoid monthly VPS hosting expenses.

I will need to manage the server's hardware and software, including things like security, monitoring, and backups.

I will learn how to build a computer, and I will learn how to configure and manage a server and services.
