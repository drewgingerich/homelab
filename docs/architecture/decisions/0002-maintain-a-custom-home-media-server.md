# 2. Maintain a custom home media server

## Context

I have an existing server that I built and use for data storage and self-hosted services.
Since I already paid for the hardware, the only ongoing expenses are electricity and my time.

Decomissioning this server would free up my time and eliminate the electricity cost.
On the other hand, I would lose the storage, services, and learning opportunities.

I could switch to using cloud/managed storage and services.
This would eliminate the maintainence burden and free up my time as well.
I already use a few managed services where there's no self-hosted alternative that fits my needs.
While some cloud storage and services are free, switching to the cloud would likely increase my monthly expenses sizably.
I would also lose the freedom, control, and privacy provided by using my own server.

I could use a virtual private server (VPS) in the cloud.
This would eliminate maintainence tasks related to hardware,
and could provide some monitoring and administration tools out of the box.
Renting a VPS with my storage and CPU needs would likely be expensive.

I could use a pre-built server running proprietary software, such as a [Synology](https://www.synology.com) product.
These softwares promise to ease system administration, access, backups, and other aspects of maintaining a server at home.
These softwares often have the ability to run self-hosted software.
The prices are generally expensive for the hardware.
These products offer less freedom, control, and privacy compared to my custom server running open-source software.

## Decision

I will continue to maintain my custom home media server.

## Consequences

I won't have to move the data on my home media server to a new location.

I won't have to set up services on a new server or find managed services to replace the self-hosted ones running on my home media server.

I won't take on new expenses.

I will continue to spend time maintaining the server.

I will continue to get opportunities to learn about system administration.
