# Tuning the speakers

Like the microphone, no digital signal processing appears to be applied to the speaker output by default.

Framework provides an EasyEffect profile for the FW 13 speakers.

The EasyEffects documentation also provides a guide for enhancing laptop speakers,
which is nice because it provides some rational for the decisions it suggests
that are applicable to the Framework-provided preset too.
